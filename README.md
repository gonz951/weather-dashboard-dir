# weather-dashboard-dir

## Description

This project was meant to be a lesson on using server api's and how to navigate them. As a website, it's meant to be easy access for putting in your city and getting your weather back as a result. The js used isn't very inventive or nuanced, but it was my honest attempt at making the api work. From this assignment, I learned how to use an input to take in data, take that data, and put it onto a webpage.

## Installation

No installation needed! Just a link: https://gonz951.github.io/weather-dashboard-dir/

(Might be finicky due to insecure source, but if opened on it's own it will work.)

## Usage

First, you go to the page and enter a city into the search bar.

The search bar will take user input and run it through the api, then translate those results onto the page.
