# weather-dashboard-dir

## Description

This project was meant to be a lesson on using server api's and how to navigate them. As a website, it's meant to be easy access for putting in your city and getting your weather back as a result. The js used isn't very inventive or nuanced, but it was my honest attempt at making the api work. From this assignment, I learned how to use an input to take in data, take that data, and put it onto a webpage.
